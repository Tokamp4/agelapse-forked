## Overview

**AgeLapse** is a cross-platform, native application for automatically stabilizing & compiling aging timelapses, i.e. "photo a day" projects. The application runs natively on desktop (Windows and MacOS) and on mobile (Android and iOS).

## Installation

Download AgeLapse: [https://agelapse.com](https://agelapse.com)

**Mobile Import Note:** To easily import a large number of photos into the mobile version, create a .zip file containing all files.

## What's New - Mobile v1.5.0

### New Features
- Photo date/time editing: Change the date and time of imported photos to ultimately re-order your project. Thanks to everyone who suggested this.
- Mirror camera setting. Thanks to everyone who suggested this.
- Manual stabilization: in the rare case where facial landmark detection fails - usually due to an obstructed face from sunglasses or a facial cover - users no longer have to exclude these photos. Instead, use the manual stabilization feature to align your eyes/face with your guidelines by hand.

### Improvements & Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue where importing .zip files on Mobile could lead to photo duplicates
- Increased gallery import limit from 9 photos to 100 photos at a time. Remember that importing a .zip file containing all your photos is always the best move.
